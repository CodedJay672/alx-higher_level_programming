# PYTHON DATA STRUCTURES

## lists

Python implements a list which is a mutable data structure. A data structure is mutable if its value can be changed without changing the ID of the object.

## Tuples

In python, Tuples are data structures that are immutable. their values do not change. To create a tupple we use parenthesis followed by a comma seperated list of values e.g 'tup = ('hello', 'world')

## Dictionaries

Just like the regular english dictionaries which contain words and their meanings, Python has a dictionary data structure which we can utilize to hold keys and values. The dictionary can be seen as a list of tupples  which makes it mutable. you can add into a dict, remove from a dict, and delete the ennter dict.

## Special methos

python allows special methods to be applied to certain data structures. They include:

1. Sorted()
2. .get()
3. .setdefault()
4. del

and so on...
